    description: Added check boxes on the results worksheet to hide low-incidence and less clinically significant antigens from the evaluation text. If either of these boxes are checked, the evaluation text will include a warning that these antigens are hidden. Note that these checkboxes do not affect the worksheet and are cleared whenever the results worksheet is opened or a new panel is loaded.
