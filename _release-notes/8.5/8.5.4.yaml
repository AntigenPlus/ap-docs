    description: Downloaded and imported commercial lot data is now checked against the database. If the downloaded data matches an existing lot, that lot is updated and the user is notified of any panels containing test cells that were modified by the import. If the downloaded data has the same lot number as an existing lot, the user is prompted to enter a unique lot number for the new lot.

    description: Moved the ability to import a company key using the command line from the main application to a separate utility named ImportCompanyKey.exe.

    description: Several third-party libraries that were only used in 8.0 have been removed from the installer.
