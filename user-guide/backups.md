# Backing Up

If you use Cloud storage for Antigen Plus, your database (s) is backed up on our
Cloud server hosted by Microsoft Azureâ„¢ and can be restored at any moment going
back one week. Any problems retrieving data should be immediately brought to our
attention at
[customerservice@antigenplus.com](mailto:customerservice@antigenplus.com).
Backing up locally can be done from inside the application (see page 4) or with
a tool such as SQL Server Management Studio.
