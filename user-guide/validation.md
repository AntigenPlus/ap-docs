# Validation

Antigen Plus provides a template for validation of the software based on the
[NAACLS](https://www.naacls.org) format on its website
[www.antigenplus.com](http://www.antigenplus.com/documentation-downloads/). It
is intended to be modified to meet the protocols and standards of the individual
institution, but may be reliably used as is to validate the software. Antigen
Plus provides technical support for this process.

The panels provided are electronically verified to match with the specification
sheets provided by the supplier. The phenotypic information printed on a
selected or results panel can be validated by assuring that its data exactly
match the data from the suppliers. Part of a laboratory's validation procedure
should be to print several lot panels and have the responsible technologist
compare them with the supplier's data sheets.

Antigen Plus makes no decision or final recommendation on the meaning of test
results or on patient care â€” this is the user's responsibility. Antigen Plus
uses the logic recommended by the American Association of Blood Banks to
evaluate initial test results in the same way a technologist would do.
