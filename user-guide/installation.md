## Installation

Antigen Plus will supply your IT department with the installer file and
documentation necessary to deploy the program to an application server or to
individual workstations. once you are set up (these procedures are covered in
our Installation Guides that comes with the installer).

### For Lab Administrators Only

First Use and Set-up:

The first person to use Antigen Plus will have administrator privileges and
should accomplish a few tasks before others use the program. Your IT will have
installed the program according to the instructions in the Installation Guide.
If someone other than you has _**run**_ the program, you should have that person
assign you administrative rights within the program. Once you are logged in as
an administrator, these are the steps:

1. Go to Options/System Options/Printing and type the name of the lab the way
   you want it to appear on any printouts

2. Go to Options/Customize result columns and set up the columns in the way you
   would like for general use (users can change these for individual work-ups,
   but this what they will always start with).

3. Go to Options/ Exclusion criteria and set the number of rule-outs for each
   antigen to exclude the corresponding antibody.

4. Go to User/Security settings and set the time-out parameters. If you are
   **not** using Windows accounts for users to log in, then set the password
   requirements, then go to User/Account settings and set up your staff with
   usernames and passwords. All of these functions are described in the Menus
   section below.
