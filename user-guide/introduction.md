# Introduction

Antigen Plus is a red blood cell inventory and antigen search program that
allows the user to enter test results that are automatically evaluated to assist
with the interpretation of those results. It is designed to permit fast and easy
data entry of test panels, and to search the data for any combination of
antigens you choose. It is intended to quickly select donor cells with
particular phenotypes for antibody identification studies and to speed up the
interpretation process for the blood bank technologist.

The data stored for each donor are:

- Donor ID
- Optional Donor Note
- Lot Number
- Vial Number
- Expiration Date
- Optional Retesting Information on expired cells
- Supplier Name
- Location (optional)
- Phenotype Designation
- Sex
- Blood Group
- 28 Principal Antigens Phenotype
- Additional Antigens - user-defined special typings
- Frozen flag
- Out-of-Stock flag

Data that can be stored for a patient are:

- ID number \*
- Name (First\*, Middle, Last\*)
- Date of birth
- Short note (held in the patient record only)
- Description on a saved panel
- Phenotype Designation
- Conclusion Antibodies
- Conclusion Notes to appear also on the screen or on saved panels
- Specimen Numbers

\*required fields

Data that can be stored on a saved panel are:

- All the data described above
- Test results (negative or positive reactions to donor cells, auto control
  cell, and check cells) recorded on a Results Worksheet
- Test results evaluations
- Name of technologist and dates of test for each Results column
- Names of up to two panel reviewers

The user may specify any combination of antigens to search for, search the data
and select any cells desired. At this point, the user may immediately print or
save the selected cells panel with or without a patient, or they may enter their
test results into a results worksheet panel and then save it with a selected
patient. The user may store and retrieve the selected panels with any test
results as desired. Antigen Plus Version 8 must be run from inside Microsoft
Windows Vista or later. It requires a printer that can print in Landscape format
(11 x 8Â½).
