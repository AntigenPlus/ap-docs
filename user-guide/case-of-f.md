# The Case of **f**

Some manufacturers have stopped typing all or most donors for the f antigen.
While the RhHR phenotype indicates the value of f, it does not do so with 100
percent certainty. Antigen Plus will not make this assumption. Therefore, if f
does not appear on the donor cell or cells, those cells will not be evaluated
for f, and f will appear as not ruled out in the evaluation. Your SOP should
indicate how you wish to handle these situations. You may ignore the lack of
exclusion, or you may add the f to the donor cell supplied by the manufacturer.
Antigen Plus makes no recommendation in this regard.

Because the f is likely to be ignored, we have exempted our Kpa and Jsa
conditional rules (see above) from considering f.
