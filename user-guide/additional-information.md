# Additional Information About Antigen Plus

Antigen Plus is written using Microsoft Visual Studio and SQL Server. It was
designed for the reference laboratory by Michael W. Lankiewicz, M.D., a
hematologist with an overworked staff, in order to save untold hours of
searching and drudgery; and originally programmed by Peter Rowny, a blood donor,
with additional improvements for the hospital transfusion service designed by
Dawn M. Rumsey, ART (CSMLS) BB(ASCP)CM.
